Offical Guide to installing ESX-Legacy and Overextended recipe.

## Windows

### Step 1: Installing Windows Artifacts

1) Install the newest version of artifacts [Download Link](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/).

For me is newest version 6248.

2) When you have the artifacts downloaded, extract them to folder where you want to have a server.

3) Then you will see in artifacts folder FXServer.exe.

Click on it and it should automatically open the web page in your browser if not click on the ip address it should be displayed there.

### Step 3: Select recipe

Here the paths are divided, we can choose whether we want basic esx or advanced esx with overextended scripts (ox_inventory, ox_target etc). So here we select Remote URL Template
